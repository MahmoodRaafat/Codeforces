A - PolandBall and Hypothesis

PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a 
following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer 
m number n*m + 1 is a prime number". Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and 
doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that 
finds a counterexample for any n.

Input
The only number in the input is n (1 <= n <= 1000) â€” number from the PolandBall's hypothesis.

Output
Output such m that n*m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if 
you output any suitable m such that 1 <= m <= 10^3. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.
